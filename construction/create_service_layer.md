Lets build the service layer for the following system and database schema.
Let's use the repository pattern with interfaces, models, and exceptions.

The system description is as follows:
```
PixyProxy is a system designed to provide API endpoints for image creation from prompts, storage of image metadata and content, listing of image details, and delivery of image content. 

The system is built on Python and uses the FastAPI framework to manage images generated from LLM prompts. Each image is uniquely identified by a GUID for public use and an internal integer ID. Additional data associated with each image includes the image data itself, the filename, the prompt used for its generation, and timestamps.

Users can interact with the API to generate an image from a provided prompt and retrieve one or multiple images along with their details.

The API is structured into four distinct layers:

1. The `/data` layer serves as the database layer, adopting a repository pattern. MySQL is used for storing relational data, while a /images folder is used for storing the images. This layer is also responsible for converting models to dictionaries and vice versa for efficiency. SQL commands utilize named parameters, and initialization logic is contained in an `init.py` module.

2. The `/service` layer is responsible for handling image prompt requests. Models incoming from the web layer are revalidated using pydantic. All exceptions, whether originating from the database or service layer, are handled using a general `ImagePromptException` format.

3. The `/core` layer is centered around models and exceptions, all of which extend `ImagePromptException`.

4. The `/web` layer, or the resource layer, handles image prompts. It employs a dependency pattern to ensure authenticated access to methods and includes a dependency for universal logging of all requests.

The API supports operations such as searching by prompt, filename, GUID, fetching an image by GUID, and fetching all image details within pagination limits. These endpoints return responses in JSON format.

The system also implements universal request logging in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:min:sec,ms {{LoggingLevel}} {{request-id}} [thread-id] [method:line number] REQUEST START  (or REQUEST END)`. The request-id is generated from host-datetime-threadid. All exceptions are managed by a single exception handler.
```

Let's make sure to cover the following use cases for our system:
```
Use Case 1: Create an Image
- Description: This use case allows users to create an image by providing a prompt. The system will generate an image based on the provided prompt.
- Steps:
  1. User provides a prompt.
  2. System generates an image based on the prompt.
  3. System stores the image, prompt, and associated metadata.
  4. System returns the GUID of the created image.

Use Case 2: Get Image Details by GUID
- Description: This use case allows users to retrieve the details of an image by providing its GUID.
- Steps:
  1. User provides a GUID.
  2. System fetches the image details associated with the provided GUID.
  3. System returns the GUID, filename, prompt, and timestamps of the image in JSON format.

Use Case 3: Get All Image Details
- Description: This use case allows users to retrieve the details of all images stored in the system.
- Steps:
  1. User requests all image details.
  2. System fetches all image details.
  3. System returns the details of all images, including the GUID, filename, and prompt, in JSON format.

Use Case 4: Retrieve an Image
- Description: This use case allows users to retrieve an image by providing its GUID.
- Steps:
  1. User provides a GUID.
  2. System fetches the image associated with the provided GUID.
  3. System returns the image bytes in the body of the response.
```

Here are the database repository interfaces to use:
```python
class ImageRepositoryInterface:
    """
    Interface for the ImageRepository.
    Author: djjay
    Date: 2022-03-30
    """

    def create_image(self, guid: str, filename: str, prompt: str) -> Image:
        """
        Creates an image.

        Parameters:
        guid (str): The GUID of the image.
        filename (str): The filename of the image.
        prompt (str): The prompt used to generate the image.

        Returns:
        Image: The created image.
        """
        pass

    def get_image_by_guid(self, guid: str) -> Image:
        """
        Gets an image by GUID.

        Parameters:
        guid (str): The GUID of the image.

        Returns:
        Image: The image.
        """
        pass

    def get_all_image_details(self) -> List[Image]:
        """
        Gets all image details.

        Returns:
        List[Image]: The details of all images.
        """
        pass

    def get_image_content(self, guid: str) -> bytes:
        """
        Gets the content of an image by GUID.

        Parameters:
        guid (str): The GUID of the image.

        Returns:
        bytes: The content of the image.
        """
        pass
```

Here are the core model objects to use:
```python
class ImageDetailCreate(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    prompt: str

class ImageDetail(ImageDetailCreate):
    id: int
    guid: str
    timestamp: datetime
```

Here are the exceptions to use:
```python
class ImageException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

class DBConnectionError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("A connection to the database could not be established.")

class RecordNotFoundError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("The requested record was not found.")

class ImageNotFoundError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("The requested image was not found.")

class ConstraintViolationError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("A database constraint was violated.")

```

The service layer is responsible for transaction management and business logic and validation.
Create the service layer interface, then implement it.

Assume we have the following DatabaseContext class:
```python
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector.pooling import MySQLConnectionPool

class DbContext:
    def __init__(self, db_connection_string):
        self.pool = MySQLConnectionPool(pool_name="mypool", pool_size=10, **db_connection_string)

def get_cursor(self):
        self.conn = self.pool.get_connection()
        return self.conn.cursor()

def start_transaction(self):
    self.conn.start_transaction()

def commit(self):
    self.conn.commit()
    self.conn.close()

def rollback(self):
    self.conn.rollback()
    self.conn.close()

```

Let's generate:
* a list of files needed to cleanly implement the service interface and implementation
* complete code for the service layer
* implement Pydantic object violations for all public function signatures and return appropriate core exceptions
* each major service method should start and manage a transaction using the DatabaseContext class
* specify types and salient docstrings for all public function signatures
- Don't forget to separate initialisation code into service/__init__.py
- Let's assume use of python-dotenv to read in configuration items
- Include a sample .env file with any configuration items needed
- Make sure the code is smartly commented when necessary, and all methods are implemented completely. 
- Provide a description at the top of each file that includes the authors name (djjay), and today's date.

Make a XServiceInterface class and a XService class for each of the following:
ImageService

The way we intend to use DatabaseContext is as follows:

```python
 with DatabaseContext() as db:
            try:
                db.start_transaction()
                # do some work
                db.commit_transaction()
                # return result
            except ImageException as known_exc:
                traceback.print_exc()
                db.rollback_transaction()
                raise known_exc
            except Exception as e:
                traceback.print_exc()
                db.rollback_transaction()
                raise ImageException("An unexpected error occurred while processing your request.") from e

```

## Response

To implement the service layer for the PixyProxy system, we will create the following files:

1. `service/__init__.py`: This file will contain the initialization code for the service layer.
2. `service/image_service.py`: This file will contain the `ImageServiceInterface` and `ImageService` classes.

Here is the pseudocode for the service layer:

1. Define the `ImageServiceInterface` class with the following methods:
   - `create_image`
   - `get_image_details_by_guid`
   - `get_all_image_details`
   - `retrieve_image`

2. Define the `ImageService` class that implements the `ImageServiceInterface`:
   - In each method, start a transaction using the `DatabaseContext` class.
   - Implement the business logic for each method.
   - Catch any exceptions and rollback the transaction if necessary.
   - Commit the transaction if everything is successful.
   - Return the appropriate result.

Now, let's implement the service layer:

```python
# service/__init__.py
# Author: djjay
# Date: Today's date

from .image_service import ImageService

__all__ = ['ImageService']
```

```python
# service/image_service.py
# Author: djjay
# Date: Today's date

    def create_image(self, image_detail_create: ImageDetailCreate) -> str:
        with self.db_context as db:
            try:
                db.start_transaction()
                guid = self.image_repository.create_image(image_detail_create.prompt)

                image = self.image_repository.get_image_details_by_guid(guid)
                if not image:
                    raise RecordNotFoundError()
                db.commit()
                return image
            except Exception as e:
                db.rollback()
                raise ImageException("An unexpected error occurred while processing your request.") from e

    def get_all_image_details(self) -> List[ImageDetail]:
        with self.db_context as db:
            try:
                db.start_transaction()
                images = self.image_repository.get_all_image_details()
                db.commit()
                return images
            except Exception as e:
                db.rollback()

    def retrieve_image(self, guid: str) -> bytes:
        with self.db_context as db:
            try:
                db.start_transaction()
                image_bytes = self.image_repository.retrieve_image(guid)
                if not image_bytes:
                    raise ImageNotFoundError()
                db.commit()
                return image_bytes
            except Exception as e:
                db.rollback()
                raise ImageException("An unexpected error occurred while processing your request.") from e
```

Here is a sample `.env` file:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB

_PORT

=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=pixyproxy
```

This service layer implementation follows the repository pattern and uses the FastAPI framework for managing images. It handles image prompt requests, validates models using Pydantic, and handles exceptions using a general `ImageException` format. It also manages transactions using the `DatabaseContext` class.
