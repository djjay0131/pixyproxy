Lets build the core model layer for the following system and database schema.
The system description is as follows:
```
PixyProxy is a system designed to provide API endpoints for image creation from prompts, storage of image metadata and content, listing of image details, and delivery of image content. 

The system is built on Python and uses the FastAPI framework to manage images generated from LLM prompts. Each image is uniquely identified by a GUID for public use and an internal integer ID. Additional data associated with each image includes the image data itself, the filename, the prompt used for its generation, and timestamps.

Users can interact with the API to generate an image from a provided prompt and retrieve one or multiple images along with their details.

The API is structured into four distinct layers:

1. The `/data` layer serves as the database layer, adopting a repository pattern. MySQL is used for storing relational data, while a /images folder is used for storing the images. This layer is also responsible for converting models to dictionaries and vice versa for efficiency. SQL commands utilize named parameters, and initialization logic is contained in an `init.py` module.

2. The `/service` layer is responsible for handling image prompt requests. Models incoming from the web layer are revalidated using pydantic. All exceptions, whether originating from the database or service layer, are handled using a general `ImagePromptException` format.

3. The `/core` layer is centered around models and exceptions, all of which extend `ImagePromptException`.

4. The `/web` layer, or the resource layer, handles image prompts. It employs a dependency pattern to ensure authenticated access to methods and includes a dependency for universal logging of all requests.

The API supports operations such as searching by prompt, filename, GUID, fetching an image by GUID, and fetching all image details within pagination limits. These endpoints return responses in JSON format.

The system also implements universal request logging in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:min:sec,ms {{LoggingLevel}} {{request-id}} [thread-id] [method:line number] REQUEST START  (or REQUEST END)`. The request-id is generated from host-datetime-threadid. All exceptions are managed by a single exception handler.
```

Here is the database schema to use:
```

CREATE TABLE `images` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `guid` VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  `filename` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `prompt` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `created_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `updated_at` TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  UNIQUE KEY `Images_U1` (`guid`),
  KEY `Images_I1` (`filename`),
  KEY `Images_I2` (`created_at`),
  KEY `Images_I3` (`updated_at`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;


```
Let's make sure to cover the following use cases for our system:
```
Use Case 1: Create an Image
- Description: This use case allows users to create an image by providing a prompt. The system will generate an image based on the provided prompt.
- Steps:
  1. User provides a prompt.
  2. System generates an image based on the prompt.
  3. System stores the image, prompt, and associated metadata.
  4. System returns the GUID of the created image.

Use Case 2: Get ImageDetails by GUID
- Description: This use case allows users to retrieve the details of an image by providing its GUID.
- Steps:
  1. User provides a GUID.
  2. System fetches the image details associated with the provided GUID.
  3. System returns the ImageDetails including GUID, filename, prompt, and timestamps of the image in JSON format.

Use Case 3: Get All ImageDetails
- Description: This use case allows users to retrieve the details of all images stored in the system.
- Steps:
  1. User requests all image details.
  2. System fetches all image details.
  3. System returns the ImageDetails of all images, including the GUID, filename, and prompt, in JSON format.

Use Case 4: Retrieve an Image
- Description: This use case allows users to retrieve an image by providing its GUID.
- Steps:
  1. User provides a GUID.
  2. System fetches the image associated with the provided GUID.
  3. System returns the image bytes in the body of the response.
```

For the content of the core layer, let's generate two files:

## core/models.py

Let's make sure that for each model object, say X, we have a class for the data items
it takes to make X (named class XCreate), a class for the data items we need to update X
(named class XUpdate extending XCreate), and a class for the data items we need to display X
(named class X extending XUpdate).
Use pydantic for the models

## core/exceptions.py

Let's make sure to have a custom exception for each error condition that can occur in the system.
Every exception should extend a class called ImageException that itself extends Exception.

For the data layer exceptions, let's generate:
class DBConnectionError(ImageException):
* a connection to the database could not be established

class RecordNotFoundError(ImageException):
* The requested record was not found.:

Make sure the exceptions can be raised with a message.
For example: 
    class ImageException(Exception):
        def __init__(self, message: str):
            self.message = message
            super().__init__(self.message)


class ConstraintViolationError
* a database constraint was violated

- Provide a description at the top of each file that includes the authors name (djjay), and today's date.


## Response

Based on the provided information, we can generate the `core/models.py` and `core/exceptions.py` files. 

The `core/models.py` file will contain the Pydantic models for creating, updating, and displaying an image. 

The `core/exceptions.py` file will contain custom exceptions for handling error conditions in the system.

Here's the Python code for these files:

```python
# core/models.py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional
from datetime import datetime

class ImageCreate(BaseModel):
    filename: str
    prompt: str

class ImageUpdate(ImageCreate):
    filename: Optional[str] = None
    prompt: Optional[str] = None

class Image(ImageUpdate):
    id: int
    guid: str
    timestamp: datetime

# core/exceptions.py
class ImageException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

class DBConnectionError(ImageException):
    pass

class RecordNotFoundError(ImageException):
    pass

class ConstraintViolationError(ImageException):
    pass
```

In `core/models.py`, we define three classes: `ImageCreate`, `ImageUpdate`, and `Image`. `ImageCreate` is used when creating a new image, `ImageUpdate` extends `ImageCreate` and is used when updating an image, and `Image` extends `ImageUpdate` and is used when displaying an image.

In `core/exceptions.py`, we define a base exception `ImageException` and three other exceptions that extend `ImageException`: `DBConnectionError`, `RecordNotFoundError`, and `ConstraintViolationError`. These exceptions are used to handle specific error conditions in the system.
