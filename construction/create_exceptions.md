Let's update the system exceptions to include service layer exceptions and web layer exceptions.

The current exceptions we have are:

```python
# data/exceptions.py
"""
This module defines custom exceptions for the data layer of the PixyProxy system.
These exceptions are used to handle and communicate specific error conditions that can occur in the data layer, such as database connection issues, record not found errors, image not found errors, and database constraint violations.

class ImageException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message: str):
        self.message = message
        super().__init__(self.message)

class DBConnectionError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("A connection to the database could not be established.")

class RecordNotFoundError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("The requested record was not found.")

class ImageNotFoundError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("The requested image was not found.")

class ConstraintViolationError(ImageException):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("A database constraint was violated.")


```

- For the service layer, add a DataValidationError, that is used to validate input data to requests, and an InvalidOperationError to be used when an invalid service operation is called.

- For the web layer, let's add a BadRequestError, and and EndPointNotFoundError.  

- Include an EXCEPTION_STATUS_CODES map to define the common numerical http error codes. 

- Use comments to separate the core, data, and web layer exceptions.  
- Update the description as well.
