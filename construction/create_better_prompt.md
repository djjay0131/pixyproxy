You are an expert in rewriting software architect instructions into a
readable useful system description, suitable for further processing by a LLM.

You are to re-write a prompt that will be used to give back to the LLM for processing. The prompt 
as specified by your architect is as follows:
```
{prompt}
```

Rewrite that prompt, without losing detail, but in a way that is more
readable and useful for further processing by a LLM.
